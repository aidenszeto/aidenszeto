### Hi there 👋

I'm Aiden, a Computer Engineering student at UCLA. I'm passionate about space technology, embedded systems and entrepreneurship, and I have extensive experience leading and building products from the ground up. This summer I will be joining Meta as a Software Engineer Intern.

Most recently, I was a SWE Intern at NASA on the command and data handling team for the Artemis avoinics division, where I worked on time-triggered ethernet for the [Gateway](https://www.nasa.gov/gateway/overview) HALO module. I am currently the CTO of [Nomad](https://visitnomad.com/) and the dev lead for [ELFIN](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/), and my prior experiences include a SWE Internship at CDK Global, MLH Fellowship, and Undergraduate Research at the [UCLA Micro and Nano Manufacturing Lab](https://www.cjkimlab.ucla.edu/).
  
Some of my work include:  
- 🌕 [Gateway](https://www.nasa.gov/gateway), NASA's Moon outpost that will support Artemis missions and deep space exploration
- 🍐 [Pearpy](https://pypi.org/project/pearpy/), a Python package that simplifies process parallelization across multiple CPU threads
- 🛰️ [ELFIN](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/), UCLA's award winning 3U cubesat satellites measuring electron scattering in low earth orbit 
- 🏠 [Nomad](https://visitnomad.com/), a prop-tech startup SaaS platform disrupting the homesharing industry  

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidenszeto/), my [personal portfolio](https://aidenszeto.me/), or you can [email me](mailto:aidenszeto@g.ucla.edu). Thanks!
