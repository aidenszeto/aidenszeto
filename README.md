### Hi there üëã

I'm Aiden, a Computer Science student at UCLA. I'm passionate about computer networking, space technology, and entrepreneurship, and I have experience leading and building products from the ground up. Currently, I'm a Data Science Intern @nasa.

Most recently, I was a SWE Intern @facebook working on data de-identification in Privacy Infrastructure. Before that, I was a SWE Intern @nasa on the command and data handling team for the Artemis avoinics division, where I worked on time-triggered ethernet for the [Gateway](https://www.nasa.gov/gateway/overview) HALO module. I am currently the dev lead for [ELFIN](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/), and my prior experiences include a SWE Internship at CDK Global, MLH Fellowship, [Undergraduate Research](https://www.cjkimlab.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, and Co-Founding [Nomad](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vhomesgroup) (successfully exited).
  
Some of my work include:  
- üåï [Gateway](https://www.nasa.gov/gateway), NASA's Moon outpost that will support Artemis missions and deep space exploration
- üçê [Pearpy](https://pypi.org/project/pearpy/), a Python package that simplifies process parallelization across multiple CPU threads
- üõ∞Ô∏è [ELFIN](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/), UCLA's award winning 3U cubesat satellites measuring electron scattering in low earth orbit
