### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aiden. I graduated in June 2024 from UCLA with a BS in Computer Science. I am currently working on Search and Vector Search at MongoDB.

Most recently, I was a SWE intern working on [Unsteady Pressure Sensitive Paint](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/unsteady-pressure-sensitive-paint-application-on-nasa-s-space-launch-system-at-nasa-ames) at NASA.
Before that, I worked on database replication at MongoDB, NLP for [NOTAMs](https://www.notams.faa.gov/) at Ames Research Center, data de-identification of [Off-Facebook Activity](https://engineering.fb.com/2019/08/20/data-infrastructure/off-facebook-activity/) at Meta, and time-triggered ethernet for the [Gateway](https://www.nasa.gov/gateway/overview) HALO module at Johnson Space Center. I was previously the software lead for [UCLA ELFIN](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/), and my prior experiences also include a SWE internship at [CDK Global](https://www.cdkglobal.com/), [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/), [Research](https://www.cjkimlab.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, and Co-Founding [Nomad](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vhomesgroup).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidenszeto/). Thanks!
